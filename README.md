# My Tech-Blog 

This is not a techinically very serious tech blog. It is now kind of a grow-up record of my tech journey. I put my summaries or mindmaps there. Some day I hope this blog can be meaningful and inspring for somebody.

This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the theme `PaperMod`.

> > This blog theme is used by **Lilian Weng** [here](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/).  And I started the idea to record my thoughts through learning while reading her blog. Her work about large language model and neural networks is very inspring.
